# 🧠 AI-Based Timetable Generator using CSP

This project is a **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)**-based solution to automatically generate **clash-free academic timetables** for educational institutions. Built with Python, it ensures optimal scheduling by considering constraints like teacher availability, room allocation, course timings, and department sections.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Automatic clash-free timetable generation**
- 🏫 Supports multiple **departments**, **sections**, and **rooms**
- 👨‍🏫 Considers **teacher availability and preferences**
- 📅 Weekly timetable generation
- 📤 Ready for integration with frontend and PDF export

---

## 📌 Technologies Used

- **Python** for core logic
- **CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem)** for optimization

---

## 🧠 CSP Overview

The algorithm applies:
- **Backtracking Search**
- **Forward Checking**
- **MRV (Minimum Remaining Values) heuristic**
- **Degree heuristic**
- **Least Constraining Value (LCV)**

This approach ensures that each class is scheduled in a way that satisfies all given constraints without overlaps.
